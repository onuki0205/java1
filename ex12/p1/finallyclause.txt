  throw the exception because "count" become 2 when "++count" do. So, exception is caught by catch block and print out "(2) Exception occurred".
  And , finally block definitely do at the end. so print out "(2) in finally clause".

2.Because finally block do always.

3.
  when count is 3, break the loop. So print out "Main program ends" at the end in main method.
